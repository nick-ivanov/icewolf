# icewolf

Icewolf is an open-source lightweight easily-configurable web-browser implemented in JavaFX. It is primarly intended to be a starting point for other developers who want to implement something interesting upon it. Icewolf's source code is easy-to-understand and is ready for hacking. We are looking forward to seeing your amazing ideas come true as a contribution or fork.

Sincerely yours,
Nick, Greg, Dylan.
